        <p class='about-me-text'>Hello! My name is Andrew Hercules and I'm a London-based developer, designer, and digital strategist. And yes, in case you're wondering, my last name really is Hercules, just like the famous Greek hero!</p>
        <p class='about-me-text'>I'm currently working for the <a href="http://ulcc.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of London Computer Centre (ULCC)</a> as a Developer and Technical Support Specialist. Prior to joining ULCC, I worked for <a href='http://www.deloittedigital.com/eu' target='_blank'>Deloitte Digital</a> in their London studios as a Front-End Developer and UX Consultant. I have also worked as a freelance digital consultant, a freelance writer, and as a Communications Coordinator for the University of Toronto Scarborough.</p>
        <p class='about-me-text'>When I'm not coding, learning a new language or framework, or reading up on economics, technology, and digital marketing, you can find me dabbling in some creative writing (mostly because I want to win an Academy Award!), checking out the newest hot yoga studio, playing tennis and pretending I'm just as good as Venus Williams or Andy Murray at Wimbledon, or hanging from a ceiling and practicing circus arts like I'm a Cirque du Soleil artist.</p>
