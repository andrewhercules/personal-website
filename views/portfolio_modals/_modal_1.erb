                <a href="http://www.bloom.london.ac.uk/about" target="_blank">Bloom</a> is a flexible, reliable, and customisable e-learning solution
                developed by the Software Services team at the University of London (UoL). It is used by 3 million users in more than 90 colleges, universities,
                and education/training institutions across the United Kingdom.

                In March 2016, I began working on a comprehensive user research project to reimagine and redesign the user experience and user interface.
                The goal of the project is to create an "out-of-the-box" service offering that meets the needs of all users  - from students to lecturers to
                learning technologists - while enhancing the learning experience for students.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the co-lead researcher, I used a range of quantitative and qualitative research methods - including competitor analysis,
                one-to-one interviews, focus groups, and surveys - to better understand how users are currently using Bloom and other virtual learning environments. I
                transcribed and analysed the research to generate insights and findings that were used to create various research outputs, including:

                  <p><a href="docs/portfolio/bloom/sample_personas.pdf">Personas</a> for student, lecturer, and learning technologist users</p>
                </li>

                  <p>User journeys for both <a href="docs/portfolio/bloom/sample_user_journey_mobile.pdf">mobile</a> and <a href="docs/portfolio/bloom/sample_user_journey_desktop.pdf">desktop/laptop</a> experiences</p>

                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In addition, I repurposed our research outputs for content marketing purposes and created a white paper,
                <a href="docs/portfolio/bloom/research_whitepaper.pdf"><em>Top 5 Research Findings: The Student Experience With Moodle</em></a> and a
                <a href="docs/portfolio/bloom/ed_tech_magazine_article.pdf">magazine article for <em>Education Technology</em></a>.
