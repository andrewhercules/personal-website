          Hello! My name is Andrew Hercules and I'm a London-based developer, UX designer, and digital strategist.
          And yes, in case you're wondering, my last name really is Hercules, just like the famous Greek hero!
        </p>
        <p>
          I currently work for the University of London (UoL) as a Developer and UX Researcher/Designer.
          Prior to joining UoL, I worked for Deloitte Digital in their London studios as a Front-End Developer and UX/UI Consultant.
          I have also worked as a freelance digital consultant and writer, and as a Communications Coordinator
          and Front-End Developer for the University of Toronto.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, youâ€™ll find me dabbling in some creative writing,
          checking out a hot yoga studio,
          playing tennis and pretending I'm just as good as Venus Williams or Andy Murray at Wimbledon,
          or hanging from a ceiling and practicing circus arts like I'm a Cirque du Soleil performer.
