          Hello there!
        </p>
        <p>
          My name is Andrew Hercules and I am a Cambridge-based user experience (UX) researcher and designer and digital strategist.
          And yes, in case you are wondering, my last name really is Hercules!
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am the UX Lead for <a href="http://www.opentargets.org/" target="_blank">Open Targets</a> and focus on researching, designing
          and testing features for the <a href="https://www.targetvalidation.org/" target="_blank">public platform</a>, a free web-based resource
          that integrates numerous public domain data sets and helps researchers identify and prioritise therapeutic drug targets. Prior to joining the Open Targets project,
          I worked in UX- and design-related roles for various Canadian and European organisations. I have also been a front-end developer specialising in research and data
          repositories, a communications coordinator for Canada's largest university, a writer and presenter for a radio station in the Netherlands, a freelance digital consultant,
          and a social services caseworker and youth employment specialist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, you will find me dabbling in some creative writing, checking out the newest hot yoga studio, playing tennis, tumbling at a gymnastics
          centre, or practicing circus arts on a trapeze.
