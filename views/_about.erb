          Hello! My name is Andrew Hercules and I am a Toronto-based user experience (UX) researcher and designer and digital strategist.
          And yes, in case you are wondering, my last name really is Hercules!
        </p>
        <p>
          In January 2017, I relocated back to Toronto after living in London, England for the past two years. While in London, I was employed by the
          University of London and by Deloitte Digital in UX-related roles and had the opportunity to research and design systems used by millions of
          users throughout Europe. Prior to moving to London, I worked in Toronto as a freelance digital consultant, a freelance writer, and as a
          communications coordinator and front-end developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, you will find me dabbling in some creative writing, checking out the newest hot yoga studio, playing tennis, tumbling at a gymnastics
          centre, or practicing circus arts on a trapeze.
